# ML–DL Foundations

This repository documents my structured progression from **numerical computing and data analysis** to **machine learning and deep learning**, with a strong emphasis on **understanding fundamentals, model behavior, and limitations**, rather than only achieving high performance.

The goal of this repository is to build a **solid foundation for research-oriented work in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP**.

---

## Motivation

As a research-focused undergraduate aiming for graduate studies (PhD/MSc), I am learning ML/DL from first principles to ensure:
- conceptual clarity,
- reproducibility,
- and the ability to analyze **why models succeed or fail**.

This repository serves as:
- a learning journal,
- a technical foundation,
- and preparation for applied research projects and thesis work.

## Topics Covered

### 📁 NumPy — Numerical Computing
Focus: understanding data as tensors and arrays.

Topics include:
- Array creation and manipulation
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Linear algebra operations
- Numerical intuition for ML

Purpose:
> Build low-level understanding of how data is represented and processed.

---

### 📁 Pandas — Data Analysis
Focus: structured data handling and exploration.

Topics include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature inspection and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Purpose:
> Learn how real-world datasets behave before modeling.

---

### 📁 Matplotlib — Visualization
Focus: visual diagnostics for ML/DL.

Topics include:
- Basic plotting
- Data distribution visualization
- Training/validation curves
- Error and performance analysis plots

Purpose:
> Use visualization to **understand model behavior**, not just results.

---

### 📁 ML — Machine Learning
Focus: classical machine learning fundamentals.

Topics include:
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Model evaluation metrics
- Bias–variance tradeoff
- Overfitting and regularization
- Experiments with scikit-learn
- Selected algorithms implemented from scratch

Purpose:
> Develop intuition about learning algorithms and evaluation pitfalls.

---

### 📁 DL — Deep Learning
Focus: neural networks and deep models.

Topics include:
- Neural network fundamentals
- Backpropagation intuition
- Loss functions and optimization
- PyTorch basics
- Simple CNN experiments
- Training stability and failure analysis

Purpose:
> Understand how deep models learn and **where they break down**.

---

## Learning Philosophy

- Prefer **depth over breadth**
- Favor **analysis over blind optimization**
- Write **clean, reproducible code**
- Document insights and failures, not just successes

This repository is intentionally **foundational**.  
Applied research projects and thesis work are maintained in separate repositories.

---

## Future Direction

After completing core foundations, this repository will be **frozen** and extended learning will move to:
- applied ML/DL research repositories,
- thesis-related experiments,
- domain-specific projects (medical AI, NLP, LLM analysis).
